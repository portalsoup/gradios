# gradios

A simple 2d sidescrolling space shooter to practice game making concepts.

## Command line:

### Dependencies:
Gradle

### Build steps

unpackNatives = Get lwjgl native files for openGL

run = compile and run game

## Intellij idea

Import the project from git sources and invoke the gradle targets 'unpackNatives' and 'run' to execute the game.  The gradle view may need to be refreshed before targets appear.
